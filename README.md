## Preparation (Build) Guide
---
### Using Docker (easiest to run) 
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
2. (optional) Install [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
3. Clone this repo to a directory of your choice using the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/fleetwoodmac/PokemonTeamBuilder.git
```
or by downloading repo as zip file and unzipping to desired to location 
<p align='center'>

</p>
4. Make sure Docker Desktop is running and that you have space free before proceeding.
5.  In the root directory of the program, build using the following command:

```sh
docker build -t namehere .
```

where ```namehere``` is whatever you want the docker image to be called. For example, this guide will use ```pokemonteambuilder```. *Keep the* ```.``` *in the command*. 

6. Terminal/CMD should give a success message

</p>
Verify that the image built properly using command

```sh
docker images
```

### Using Python (bit more work)

## Usage
---
### Using Docker 
1. **This is if you built the docker image.**
2. Run the following command
```sh
docker run -p 8501:8501 namehere
```
where ```namehere``` is the image name you used in step 5 of the docker build guide. You should see something like:

<p align='center'>
  <img src=https://github.com/fleetwoodmac/PokemonTeamBuilder/assets/69140036/498f0dae-43b2-4110-b0dd-683277eb4913 width='500'>
</p>

3. Copy the URL (by default, this is http://0.0.0.0:8501). paste it into a browser, and you should see the webapp come up!
<br>

<br>
4. You can verify the docker container is running using

```sh
docker container ls
```
<p align='center'>

</p>

 5. Stop the container using the command

```sh
docker stop containername
```

where ```containername``` is the text from step 4 under NAMES. In the image above, it happened to be ```peaceful_leavitt```. You can also open Docker Desktop, go to the Containers tab, and stop the container there.

## Remove/Delete program
---
### Using Docker 
1. The easiest way to do this is using Docker Desktop. 
2. Open Docker Desktop. Make sure any containers running this program are stopped.
3. In the Containers tab,  check the box for the container that has this program in it, and hit Delete.
4. In the Images tab, check the box for the image containing this program, and hit Delete.
5. Delete the directory you cloned/files you directly downloaded in the Install guide.

## Notes
---
- **While I do not collect any sort of information, Streamlit collects usage telemetry by default. This is not disabled by default.**
   - If you want to disable this, see Streamlit's documentation on the subject [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration#telemetry).

As mentioned, please feel free to fork this and start developing it more if you want--it's pretty barebones and sorta buggy in its current state. Give it a ‚≠êÔ∏è if you thought it was cool!
